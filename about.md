Hi, I am` Ankit Rana`, passionate developer, love to work in C# and javascript. 

I am always interested in low-level application problem that related to application architecture and how to communicate with third-party services.

I want to become a Solution Architecture and also want to create the artificially intelligent application.

Currently, I am interested in cloud application architecture learning blockchain, learning basic to javascript.

**My Favourites Books**

* Programming with Entity Framework Code First
* Programming  Entity Framework: Dbcontext
* ng-book 2
* C# in depth (confusing  :P)  but interesting.
