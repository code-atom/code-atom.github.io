So in Computer Science, we heard about data structure and algorithms and how they used in our application in order to increase system performance. but let start with very basic.

What is data?
In definition: Data is raw fact and observation that user collection and convert into useful information.

This is what we learned from a human perspective and we never care about how the machine can understand this. our main goal is how we can understand this data and produce valuable output.

In the real world, we save our data in tabular format, lists format, bullet points format and etc. why we format this such format, because they give us the ability to perform various operation on data.

This general used formats like the Tabular format, give us the ability to organize this data in the good structure, so that we can understand what kind of data gathered and how to construct output.

Now how our computer will understand this data and perform a fast operation on that data.For this first, we need to structure our data in the computer that we want to store in computer and perform an action on it.

Now we are in a state to define the data structure, Data Structure is a way of organizing data in memory so that it can be processed easily and efficiently.

In computer science, The logical or mathematical model of particular organization of data is called Data Structure. Data Model depends upon two things, First, it must be rich enough in structure to mirror the actual relationship of the data in the real world. On another hand, the structure should be simple enough that one can effectively process the data when necessary.
