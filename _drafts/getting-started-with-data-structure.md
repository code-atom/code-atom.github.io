So in Computer Science, we heard about data structure and algorithms and how they used in our application in order to increase system performance. but let start with very basic. 

What is data?
In definition: Data is raw fact and observation that user collection and convert into useful information.

This is what we learned from a human perspective and we never care about how the machine can understand this. our main goal is how we can understand this data and produce valuable output.

In the real world, we save our data in tabular format, lists format, bullet points format and etc. why we format this such format, because they give us the ability to perform various operation on data.

This general used formats like the Tabular format, give us the ability to organize this data in the good structure, so that we can understand what kind of data gathered and how to construct output.
