Hi, this is Azure Journey, a new blog series related to Azure Cloud and its services.
This is the first post in the series. In this, we will set up CI\\CD Pipeline using GitHub Actions to implement continuous deployment in Azure App Services.

## Prerequisite:
* GitHub Repository.
* Azure Subscription.

## Create an App Service
First, we need to create an Azure App Service Plan, as Azure App Services exists inside an Azure App Service Plan.
